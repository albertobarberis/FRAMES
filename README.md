# FRAMES v2.0


FRAMES v2.0 is a simple and free graphical spectral processing tool for [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/).  
With it you can synthesize unexpected sounds, complex spectral textures and irregular rhythmic loops.

Developed with [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) by [Alberto Barberis](www.albertobarberis.it) and [Alberto Ricca/Bienoise](www.bienoise.com), FRAMES allows you to record a sample from an Ableton Live track, to manipulate graphically its sonogram and then to resynthesize it in real-time. This technique is based on the amazing work by Jean-Francois Charles.
